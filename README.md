# goeat
You are going to make a command line app called “Go-Eat”. The app consists of drivers, stores, and a user. Every driver rated in the form of decimal number in the range of 0.0 to 5.0 and they will initially have 0 point of rating when the program runs for the first time. Each store has a menu which consists of item(s). The map which the user, drivers, and stores are placed on will be generated randomly and must be guaranteed that there is at least a path that can be taken for each driver to go to every store before finally proceeding to the user. Any additional logical assumptions is allowed.
